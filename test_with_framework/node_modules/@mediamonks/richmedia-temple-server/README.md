### Travis

This project uses [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) to build, test and
publish its code to npm. Travis is free for public Github repositories.

It runs on all commits, shows the build status for pull requests, and
publishes to npm when a new tag/release is created.

Travis only runs the `npm test` script, so have configured that script
to run everything we want Travis to check. Besides the unit tests, we
also run our validations and linters.

The travis configuration is placed in a `.travis.yml` file, consisting
of multiple sections.

1.  Defines the `node_js` [language](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs),
    and tells travis on which node versions to run the process.
2.  Before running, it needs to install some global dependencies, and
    when it processes some coverage results.
3.  It can do a [npm deploy](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/npm),
    telling it to keep the generated artifacts and only publish when run
    on node 8 and when a tag was committed. It also contains the email
    address and api key of the npm user.
4.  Code Climate has a [travis plugin](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/code-climate/)
    that automatically uploads the code coverage results.

Because we want to keep the npm api key secret, we add the token to the Travis Repo settings
where it will be stored secure:
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings

Before we can do this, we must make sure that the repository is added
to Travis, because Travis needs the repository owner/name info to make
sure the encrypted values only work for that repository.

1.  Then make sure you are logged in to your npm account with the
    [adduser](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/adduser) command:

    ```sh
    $ npm adduser
    ```

    To verify that you are logged in correctly you can check:

    ```sh
    $ npm whoami
    ```

3.  Now we need to [create a new token](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/working_with_tokens):

    ```sh
    npm token create
    ```

    Copy the token value from the output to the Travis Environment Variable settings, and
    add it with the name `NPM_TOKEN`.
